- Use everyday words only. Replace medical, legal, and formal words with simple ones (for example "discontinue" -> "stop", "prescriber" -> "the doctor who gave you this medication", "hereby authorize" -> "you allow").
- If a medical word must stay, such as the name of a procedure or condition, keep it and add a short plain explanation in round parentheses, like "cholecystectomy (surgery to take out the gallbladder)". Never use square brackets for this. Only explain what the word means.
- Talk to the reader as "you". Turn "I agree", "I understand" and "the patient should" into plain "you" sentences.
- Start instructions with a simple action word, like "Take", "Stop", "Call", "Do not".
